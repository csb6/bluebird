# Bluebird

Bluebird is a work-in-progess imperative programming language modelled after C++ and Ada. It is still in the early
stages, but right now it has a lexer and a parser that begins the creation of the parse tree. There is no code generation
or typechecking or anything else right now.

The goal is to create a language that supports generic programming with strong typing and syntax somewhere between Ada's
verbose but unambiguous syntax and C++'s more concise syntax.
