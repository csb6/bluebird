Todo:

[X] Implement rest of codegen code for working with mutable variables (see Kaleidoscope example)
[X] Review the multiprecision int code and consider switching to mini-gmp
[X] Fix bug where bit_size of types is off by 1 bit
[X] Consider simplifying how each type's bit_size is obtained
[X] Add support for signed vs. unsigned within int types
[X] Have codegen use LLVM's signed and unsigned operations on int types
[X] Add support for automatically forward declaring functions in the same way it currently works for types
[X] Run the generated IR through LLVM's verifier after codegen is complete
[X] Figure out why IRBuilder isn't keeping some arithmetic expressions, and
    creating weird constant folding outcomes in other cases
[X] Create some helper functions for printing out lexer errors (with line num)
[X] Consider rewriting lexer to be array-based and making better use
    of constexpr (this isn't practical without C++20, and even there, causes more complexity)
[X] Add support for if-statements
[X] Add typechecking/boolean checking in if-conditions
[X] Add support for else-statements
[X] Add support for else-if statements
[X] Fix bug where in an initialization expression, the variable being initialized can appear
[X] Fix bug where sometimes (~1 out of every 10 runs) the typechecker incorrectly checks
    the range of a literal (run if-block.bird example to see the error)
    - I have confirmed that this bug (with varying frequency) recurs at least as far back
      as commit 23088af. It is probably very old (since it is appears so rarely)
    - After further testing it seems like the issue is that sometimes the range's upper
      range is not being set correctly (i.e. printing the range out gives: "(0, )"
    - Issue was with complex situation of move semantics, with multiple temporaries
      being constructed/moved in a bad design
[X] Generate an object file from the LLVM IR
[X] Generate an executable from LLVM IR, possibly integrating simple C library
    functions (e.g. printf() or puts()) to have some output
[X] Add typechecking for int literals and expressions (ensuring that int literals
    are only used with expressions that evaluate to range types)
[X] Add check so that int literals are always within the range of the type they
    are being used with
[X] Add above two items for assignments/initialization statements
[X] Change build system to CMake to be more portable across Windows/Unix, set
    platform-specific linker/compiler flags more easily
[X] Add support for module-global variables
[ ] Add support for arrays of integers/characters
[ ] Figure out how strings should work
[ ] Add standard interface for adding builtin functions/types
[ ] Reorganize how Type objects are represented so that fewer structs (e.g. LValue)
    depend specifically on RangeTypes
[X] Add while-loops
[X] Add support for using parameters within a function definition
[ ] Fix bug where programs ending with a single-line comment (maybe any comment?)
    and no trailing newline segfault
[X] Add return statement and return types, enabling non-void functions
[ ] Add checks to ensure all paths out of a function have a return statement ending them
[ ] Add support for user-defined record types
[ ] Add support for creating ranges and using them within larger expressions/variables
[ ] Add simple for-loops that iterate over a range
[ ] Add support for for-loops that iterate over a RangeType's range
[ ] Add short-circuiting to logical operators, with non-short-circuiting options
[ ] Consider adding support for syntactic sugar for chained comparison:
    "`a op1 b op2 c ... y opN z` is equivalent to `a op1 b and b op2 c and ... y opN z`,
    except that each expression is evaluated at most once." (from Python docs)
[ ] Consider adding a viceversa keyword to be used with binary expressions
[ ] Work on the various TODOs throughout the codebase
[ ] Consider reading characters on-demand from an iostream in the lexer instead
    of reading everything into a big string at the start
[ ] Use property-based testing to test lexer
[ ] Consider rewriting frontend/part of frontend in Ada (this is unlikely
    to be practical but would be interesting to experiment with)
[ ] Think more about the potential for proving code, possibly using z3
