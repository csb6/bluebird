Todo:

[ ] Implement rest of codegen code for working with mutable variables (see Kaleidoscope example)
[X] Review the multiprecision int code and consider switching to mini-gmp
[X] Fix bug where bit_size of types is off by 1 bit
[X] Consider simplifying how each type's bit_size is obtained
[X] Add support for signed vs. unsigned within int types
[X] Have codegen use LLVM's signed and unsigned operations on int types
[ ] Add support for automatically forward declaring functions in the same way it currently works for types
[ ] Run the generated IR through LLVM's verifier after codegen is complete
[ ] Work on the various TODOs throughout the codebase
[ ] Think more about the potential for proving code, possibly using z3
[X] Figure out why IRBuilder isn't keeping some arithmetic expressions, and
    creating weird constant folding outcomes in other cases
[X] Create some helper functions for printing out lexer errors (with line num)
[ ] Consider reading characters on-demand from an iostream in the lexer instead
    of reading everything into a big string at the start
[X] Consider rewriting lexer to be array-based and making better use
    of constexpr (this isn't practical without C++20, and even there, causes more complexity)
[ ] Consider rewriting frontend/part of frontend in Ada (this is unlikely
    to be practical but would be interesting to experiment with)
[ ] Use property-based testing to test lexer
