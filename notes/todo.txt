Todo:

[X] Implement rest of codegen code for working with mutable variables (see Kaleidoscope example)
[X] Review the multiprecision int code and consider switching to mini-gmp
[X] Fix bug where bit_size of types is off by 1 bit
[X] Consider simplifying how each type's bit_size is obtained
[X] Add support for signed vs. unsigned within int types
[X] Have codegen use LLVM's signed and unsigned operations on int types
[X] Add support for automatically forward declaring functions in the same way it currently works for types
[X] Run the generated IR through LLVM's verifier after codegen is complete
[X] Figure out why IRBuilder isn't keeping some arithmetic expressions, and
    creating weird constant folding outcomes in other cases
[X] Create some helper functions for printing out lexer errors (with line num)
[X] Consider rewriting lexer to be array-based and making better use
    of constexpr (this isn't practical without C++20, and even there, causes more complexity)
[X] Add support for if-statements
[ ] Add typechecking/boolean checking in if-conditions
[ ] Add support for else-statements
[ ] Add support for else-if statements
[ ] Add support for module-global variables
[X] Generate an object file from the LLVM IR
[ ] Generate an executable from LLVM IR, possibly integrating simple C library
    functions (e.g. printf() or puts()) to have some output
[ ] Add typechecking for int literals and expressions (ensuring that int literals
    are only used with expressions that evaluate to range types)
[ ] Add check so that int literals are always within the range of the type they
    are being used with
[ ] Consider adding a viceversa keyword to be used with binary expressions
[ ] Work on the various TODOs throughout the codebase
[ ] Consider reading characters on-demand from an iostream in the lexer instead
    of reading everything into a big string at the start
[ ] Use property-based testing to test lexer
[ ] Consider rewriting frontend/part of frontend in Ada (this is unlikely
    to be practical but would be interesting to experiment with)
[ ] Think more about the potential for proving code, possibly using z3
