Todo:

[ ] Implement rest of codegen code for working with mutable variables (see Kaleidoscope example)
[ ] Review the multiprecision int code and consider switching to mini-gmp
[ ] Fix bug where bit_size of types is off by 1 bit
[ ] Consider simplifying how each type's bit_size is obtained
[ ] Add support for signed vs. unsigned within int types
[ ] Have codegen use LLVM's signed and unsigned operations on int types
[ ] Add support for automatically forward declaring functions in the same way it currently works for types
[ ] Run the generated IR through LLVM's verifier after codegen is complete
[ ] Work on the various TODOs throughout the codebase
